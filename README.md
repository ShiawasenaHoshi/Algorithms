* binary search
* counting sort
* insert sort
* quick sort
* Shell sort
* quick find (visual demonstration & Monte-Carlo simulation include)
* quick union (visual demonstration & Monte-Carlo simulation include)
* quick union weighted (visual demonstration & Monte-Carlo simulation include)
* quick union weighted + path compression (visual demonstration & Monte-Carlo simulation include)

Each has tests (JUnit 4)
